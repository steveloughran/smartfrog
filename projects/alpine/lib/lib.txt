This is for Java libraries in the maven2 library structure,
http://docs.codehaus.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=22230

Put things that aren't in ibiblio.org/maven2 here, with .POM and ideally
.sh1/.md5 files. Do not bother with getting dependencies in the .pom right,
as that can cause more confusion than anything else.

Do keep licenses of files with the archives, and be careful about distribution
of any Sunw licensed stuff, to make sure the Terms and Conditions of redist are
being met.
