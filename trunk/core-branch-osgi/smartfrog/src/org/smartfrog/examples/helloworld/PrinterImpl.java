 *  Basic example component.
 *  The Printer component (in printer.sf) is a basic primitive component so
 *  its component description class PrinterImpl extends PrimImpl (the base
 *  class for all the deployed components) which provides the default lifecycle
 *  template methods for a primitive component.
 *  Although PrimImpl itself implements Prim (the base interface for all the
 *  deployed components) PrinterImpl also implements Prim because it is
 *  necessary for RMI that component also does so; the rmic compiler will
 *  otherwise not behave correctly.
 *  The PrinterImpl class needs to be prepared for RMI for remote deployment
 *  This is done by creating and compiling the stubs and skeletons using the
 *  rmic compiler.
 *  This class is included in rmitargets that is read by the rmic compiler.
