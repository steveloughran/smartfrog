<p>
  This package contains classes to manage WWW deployment. Much of it is abstract or helper classes
  for application server-specific subclassing and implementation.
</p>

<p>
  The core architecture is that the deployment components are server independent, the
  application server itself providing the core deployment functionality.
  To enable this, there is a notion of delegate classes; an application context
  can create a delegate class in a component to which it hands off most of the work.
