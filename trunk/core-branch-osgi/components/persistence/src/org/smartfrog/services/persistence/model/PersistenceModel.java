 * <p>PersistenceModel is a abstract base class for all persistence models. It
 * has a static method constructModel(context) that constructs an implementation
 * of this class described in the model config data in context.</p>
 *
 * <p>The PersistenceModel controls the behavior of a recoverable component.
 * Persistence is achieved by storing attributes on stable storage, committing
 * only at certain points in the startup life cycle and when attributes change
 * after the component has started.</p>
 *
 * <p>The persistence model modifies the behavior of the recoverable component
 * by vetoing attributes and commit points and by modifying the component's
 * context before deployment.</p>
 *
 * <p>The model can veto attributes by identifying them as volatile
 * (the isVolatile method). Volatile attributes are not written to persistent
 * storage. Similarly the model can also veto commit points duing the
 * startup life cycle (the isCommitPoint method).</p>
 *
 * <p>Prior to deployWith, the model is given the opportunity to
 * modify the persistent component's context. Two methods are provided to
 * differentiate initial startup and recovery startup (the initialContext
 * and recoverContext methods).</p>
