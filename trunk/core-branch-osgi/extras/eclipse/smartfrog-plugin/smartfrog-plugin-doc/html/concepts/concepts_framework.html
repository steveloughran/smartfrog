<h1>SmartFrog framework </h1>
<p>The SmartFrog framework consists of three major elements:</p>
<ol>
<li>
the configuration language</li>
<li>the runtime deployment engine</li>
<li>the set of components to be deployed</li>
</ol>

<a name="language"></a>
<h2>SmartFrog language</h2>
<p>The SmartFrog language is a declarative, data description language, supporting 
hierarchical attribute:value pairs, used to capture complete service configurations. 
The language supports templates using a prototype approach, meaning that any 
configuration description instance can act as a prototype for a new one, which 
can overwrite and extend the original. This mechanism allows a configuration to 
be progressively specialized, without overwriting configuration files 
(a common source of error). The language also supports various attribute 
linking features, which prevent configuration data from needing to be 
duplicated in multiple places (another common source of error).</p>
<p>The language provides support for composition, which is the ability to create a 
larger configuration form a combination of smaller ones, This maps directly 
into the requirement to be able to compose larger systems from smaller ones. 
Additionally, there are various language escape mechanisms that permit the 
inclusion of arbitrary functions to manipulate configuration data as part 
of the language processing stage, as well as a schema mechanism to check 
for well-formed configurations.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/c_comp&spec.gif" width="304" height="291"></p>
<p>Taken as a whole, these mechanisms allow services to be customized and assembled 
in different ways, typically by extending, customizing, and composing templates 
describing different aspects of the required service.</p>
<p>At runtime, the configuration data are interpreted by components, 
which use the data to determine their behavior. It is important to 
note that the component semantics are not understood at all at the 
language level, hence the language can be used to capture a wide range of components and models.</p>
<a name="engine"></a>
<h2>SmartFrog deployment engine</h2>
<p>
The deployment engine is a distributed, decentralized, and secure runtime mechanism to 
deploy components in the right locations with the right configuration.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/c_engine.gif" width="671" height="383"></p>
<p>The basic deployment engine consists of a SmartFrog daemon running on each node or resource. 
The daemon is capable of interpreting SmartFrog configurations, which it uses to identify 
which SmartFrog components should be loaded. Once the components are loaded, they request 
their configuration data from the deployment engine and act on the data appropriately.</p>
<p>The deployment engine can load components and descriptions from node-local storage or 
over the network from Web servers or databases. The engine is fully peer to peer, 
that is, individual nodes communicate as necessary to deploy components in the right places. 
There is no required central configuration server, though the design of the framework 
does not preclude this style of approach.</p>
<p>The deployment engine is secured through the use of public-key, cryptographic signing 
of configurations and component code. The deployment engine will only load configuration 
data and components that have been signed by an appropriately trusted authority. </p>
<a name="components"></a>
<h2>SmartFrog components</h2>
<p> SmartFrog components implement a common, simple lifecycle. This is what allows them to 
be systematically and correctly orchestrated by the framework.
</p>
<p><img src="../../images/c_components.gif" width="418" height="247"></p>
<p>Components can either implement all their intended functionality directly, 
or, more usually, they can encapsulate legacy or non-SmartFrog components, 
allowing the framework to configure and deploy assemblies of third-party applications.</p>
<p>SmartFrog components have access to a rich deployment API, which allows 
them to deploy and manage components of their own. This is a fundamental 
building block for adaptive service behavior allowing, for example, the ability 
to add Web servers to respond to increasing demand.</p>
<p>Some fundamental SmartFrog components are provided as part of the basic framework, 
including those that control deployment behavior and lifecycles across groups of components. 
Indeed, SmartFrog can be thought of as fractal since much of its functionality is 
implemented as a set of SmartFrog components.</p>
<p>Additional components can easily be added to increase the functionality of 
the system, the intent being to build a rich library of service components 
that can be configured, composed, and reused. </p>
