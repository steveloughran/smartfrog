/**
 * This component provides a list of files that match a pattern.
 * It is somewhat remiscent of an Ant fileset, but it does not expose the baseDir concept
 * of that type to the remote callers (who therefore cannot make assumptions that the list of files
 * return share a common root directory.
 *
 * Also, it uses full Java Regexp syntax for patterns, not any wild card simplification.
 * Consult http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html for the details.
 * Here are some examples
 *  "\\w+.txt"   -any word (A-Za-z0-9).txt
 *  "\\w*.txt"   -any word (A-Za-z0-9).txt, or ".txt"
