/**
 * RandomSequence is a modified sequence which differs in that the
 * sub-components operate sequentially but are started at random.
 * RandomSequence maintains a vector of the started sub-components. A
 * sub-component can not be deployed and started twice. Sub-components do not
 * share the same lifecycle. A RandomSequence combinator creates no
 * sub-components until its sfStart phase at which point the first mentioned
 * random sub-components is created in the normal way. The RandomSequence
 * combinator waits for each of its sub-components to terminate at which point
 * it starts a randomly chosen one in the action. When the last terminates
 * normally it too terminates normally. If an error occurs at any point, or a
 * sub-component terminates abnormally, the RandomSequence combinator does
 * too.
 *
 * <p>
 * The file randomsequence.sf contains the SmartFrog configuration file for the
 * base Random,Sequence combinator. This file contains the details of the
 * attributes which may be passed to Sequence.
