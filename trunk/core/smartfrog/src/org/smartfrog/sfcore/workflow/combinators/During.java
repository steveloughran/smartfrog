 * timeout combinator terminates it and itself normally. The sub-component
 * may, of course, be a further combinator such as a Sequence. The during
 * combinator creates its sub-componentent during the sfStart phase The During
 * combinator waits for its sub-components to terminate normally at which
 * point it too terminates normally. If an error occurs at any point, or a
 * sub-component terminates abnormall the During combinator terminates
 * abnormally.
