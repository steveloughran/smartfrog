/**
 * Parallel is a modified compound which differs in that the sub-components
 * operate in parallel but do not share the same lifecycle, and in particular
 * the same termination. A Parallel combinator creates no subcomponents until
 * it's sfStart phase at which point all the subcomponents are created in the
 * normal way and with synchronized or asynchronized lifecycle. The Parallel combinator waits
 * for each of its sub-components to terminate normally at which point it too
 * terminates normally. If an error occurs at any point, or a sub-component
 * terminates abnormally, the Parallel combinator does too.
 *
 * <p>
 * The file parallel.sf contains the SmartFrog configuration file for the base
 * Parallel combinator. This file contains the details of the attributes which
 * may be passed to Parallel.
