<h2>
<a NAME="s1"></a>1. Introduction</h2>
This document describes how to build the SmartFrog framework from its source
files. It describes how to set up the development system, and how to execute
the build scripts.
<h2>
<a NAME="s2"></a>2. Building SmartFrog</h2>
Here are the requirements and steps to build SmartFrog.
<h3>
<a NAME="ss2.1"></a>2.1 Hardware and Operating System Requirements</h3>
You will need a system capable of running Java at a reasonable speed. We
find that SmartFrog can be build perfectly adequately on systems of around
500Mhz with 256MB of RAM, but faster and bigger are obviously better.
<p>In theory, SmartFrog can be built on any platform capable of running
a current version of Java. In practice, we use Linux and Windows, and it's
best to stick to Windows 2000 or above.
<h3>
<a NAME="ss2.2"></a>2.2 Software Requirements</h3>

<h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400">SmartFrog has very lightweight requirements
in terms of what software must be installed in order to build the system,
but you do need to have the following:</span></h4>

<h4>
Java JDK</h4>
JDK version 1.4.1 or above is required. Once this is installed, set the
JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to the installation directory,
e.g.
<ul>
<li>
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.4.1 (Linux)</li>
</ul>
Also set the PATH environment variable to include the Java binaries directory,
e.g.
<ul>
<li>
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/java/jdk1.4.1/bin (Linux)</li>
</ul>
(For Windows, just use the method of setting environment variables supported
by your version of the OS. On Windows XP, this is accessed via "My Computer"
/ right click for "Properties" / "Advanced" tab / "Environment Variables"
button.)
<h4>
Jakarta Ant</h4>
We require Ant version 1.5 or above. Once installed, add the Ant binary
directory to the PATH, e.g.:
<ul>
<li>
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin/Ant1.5/bin (Linux)</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Open SSL</h4>
OpenSSL is only required if you need to create a certification authority
for securing SmartFrog hosts and SmartFrog code. Most of the build scripts
will run without it, so you may not need this to get started. OpenSSL (version
0.9.5a or later) is required to set up a certification authority to initialize
the security infrastructure.
<p>&nbsp;If you do install it, the openSLL binaries directory must be added
to the system PATH.
<h2>
<a NAME="ss2.5"></a>2.3 Building SmartFrog</h2>
When SmartFrog is unpacked from its tarball or zip file, there is a top
level directory, e.g. "/home/dilbert/SmartFrog", which we'll refer to as
&lt;sf_top>. Building the system, in either Linux or Windows, is as simple
as changing directory to &lt;sf_top>, and running the "ant" command from
a command line. If all is well, the system should build.
<p>You can perform a quick test of the system by changing directory to
the "dist" directory under &lt;sf_top>, and starting a SmartFrog daemon
from the command line as follows:
<ul>
<li>
bin/sfDaemon (Linux)</li>

<li>
bin\sfdaemon (Windows)</li>
</ul>
This should bring up the SmartFrog Daemon display window.
<li>

<hr></li>

<h2>
<a NAME="s3"></a>3. Troubleshooting</h2>
Make sure all the tools are stable builds of at least the minimum required
version.
<p>When in doubt, make sure you have correctly installed each tool, and
that it is running without errors. Run "java -version", and "ant", and
check for sensible output.
<p>Double-check environment variables.
<p>The build may fail if your PATH environment variable contains quotes
("), and you are using Cygwin tools. Quotes are not properly translated
when passed down to cygwin sub-shells.
