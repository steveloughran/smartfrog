/**
 *  This class implements the Compound interface because it can "contain"
 *  Virtual Hosts components. The Apache interface is the Remoteable interface
 *  and the Runnable interface is used to monitor the httpd process. The httpd
 *  process is started in sfStart by setting the apacheState variable to true
 *  and ended in sfTerminate by setting the apacheState variable to false. The
 *  Internet Activator scripts are used to edit the httpd.conf file. These rely
 *  on certain environment variables being set, these variables are defined in
 *  the sf file and are passed to the common.executeScript() method. Adding them
 *  to the sf file avoids the need to hard code these paramters. The scripts are
 *  downloaded from a webserver and are then saved locally.
