/**
 * Configures a User Agent that provides access to the service location facility. 
 * - Requests are triggered when the 'sfLocationResults' attributes is looked up.
 * sfLocationResults is then replaced by the corresponding ServiceLocationEnumeration.
 * It is up to the component that triggered the request to use this Enumeration.
 *
 * - If a request is triggered, DA location is performed if no DA has been provided.
 * Smartfrog DA reference may be provided directly through the 'useDA' attribute 
 * 
 * - Bear in mind that this component only provides serviceURLs discovery, which is why only the 
 * service type has to be provided. Extensions of this component ï¿½not written in the 
 * current release- could also perform attributes discovery, et. 
 * - 'sfServiceDescription' or 'sfServiceQuery' may be used to refine the query. 
 * If both are provided only 'sfServiceQuery' is used.
