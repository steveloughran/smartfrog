<description>
  Build file for ssh SmartFrog components.

  For the functional test, set test.ssh.host to the name of a host, including, obviously, localhost

  This build file assumes that if you are building on any unix, you can ssh in to localhost as yourself.
  If this is not the case, set test.ssh.host = ""
