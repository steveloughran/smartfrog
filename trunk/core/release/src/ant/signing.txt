This is a build file that is designed to be redistributed as part of a tar file,
then executed to create a new RPM with signed artifacts.

It requires
* Ant1.7.0+
* A linux system with rpmbuild on the path

It looks for a build.properties file in
 - the current directory
 - the parent.project.dir (Default = ../..)

It looks for security properties in a file called security.properties
in (and in the current order)
 - the current directory
 - the parent.project.dir (Default = ../..)
 - ~/.ant

To run this build file, you must have a CA set up.

1. Point smartfrog.install.dir (in a security.properties file) at the
  directory in which SmartFrog is installed.
2. In that directory, run
    ant initCA
  to create a CA


How it works

When the main SmartFrog RPMs are released, a directory tree is built up
containing all the files -and all symbolic links pointing to the files which
will exist when the RPMs are installed. This tree can only be built up on a
Unix system, to enable these symlinks to be set up.

As well as building the RPMs, we run the unix tar command to create
a tar file of the directory tree, including a small Ant build file designed
to sign the JARs


This tar file can then be expanded, and run by other people, to create custom
signed SmartFrog RPMs. In these RPMs, every JAR file is signed. This means
 1. The normal Java classloader now refuses to load class or resource files
    from JARs not signed by the same signatories.
 2. SmartFrog now operates in security enabled mode.

The latter is somewhat more complex than just classloading.
