SmartFrog 3.18.016
==================

This is a new release of SmartFrog, the Java-based, LPGL-licensed
distributed deployment framework developed by HP Laboratories.

SmartFrog enables applications to be deployed across multiple machines,
configuring different aspects of the system so that they are all
consistently configured, and managing the life-cycle of the application
as a whole.


The project's home page is
  http://smartfrog.org/
The release artifacts are available at
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/smartfrog/files/development/smartfrog-3.18.016/

Artifacts for use by Ivy and Maven are available under
http://smartfrog.sourceforge.net/repository/

This release is 3.18.016; built from revision 8870
of the SVN repository.

It was compiled with the Java version set to Java 6 -it will not work
on Java1.5 JVMs.

This release includes the following items:

* The core SmartFrog daemon, including services to manage files,
  start and stop Java and native programs.
* Example components and applications.
* Ant support: ant tasks to deploy and terminate applications.
* Ant components: the ability to execute ant tasks in a deployment.
* Anubis: a partition aware tuple-space that can be used to implement
  fault tolerant systems.
* Database: components to issue database commands, and deploy HSLDB
  and MySQL databases.
* Groovy: the ability to write SmartFrog components using the
  Groovy language.
* JMX: the ability to configure and manage JMX components, and to
  manage SmartFrog components over JMX.
* Logging: integration with Apache commons-logging and Log4J, and the
  SLF4J framework.
* Networking: email, FTP, SSH, DNS support.
* Quartz: scheduled operations using Quartz libraries.
* RpmTools: components for working with or deploying with RPMs
* Scripting: support for BSF-hosted scripting languages
* Testing: Distributed JUnit and component testing with SFUnit.
* Velocity: generation/transformation of text files during deployment
* WWW: deployment of WAR and EAR files to application servers.
* Jetty: The Jetty components can configure and deploy individual
  servlets, eliminating much of the need for WAR files and
  application servers.
* XML: XML support with XOM.
* XMPP: Presence and messaging over Jabber.

Packaging
=========

This release is available as:

* RPM files inside a .tar.gz file.
* A JAR installer.
* The original core smartfrog distribution as .zip and .tar.gz
  (deprecated).
* A .tar.gz file containing everything needed to create a private set
  of RPM files containing JAR files signed by a private Certification
  Authority.


The RPM installation is for RPM-based Linux systems. The archive
contains the following RPM files:

smartfrog:            The core SmartFrog distribution.
smartfrog-daemon:     The shell scripts to add the SmartFrog distribution
                      to the path, and to run the daemon on start-up.
smartfrog-demo:       Example code and documentation.
smartfrog-javadocs:   Javadocs for the project
smartfrog-ant:        Ant task and build file execution
smartfrog-anubis:     Distributed partition-aware tuple space
smartfrog-csvfiles:   Support for reading/writing CSV Files.
smartfrog-database:   Database access

smartfrog-jmx:        JMX integration though MX4J
smartfrog-junit:      Junit 3.8.2 test execution
smartfrog-logging:    Logging through Log4J and commons-logging
smartfrog-networking: SSH, SCP, FTP and email
smartfrog-quartz:     Scheduled operations
smartfrog-rpmtools:   RPM support tools
smartfrog-scripting:  Scripted components
smartfrog-velocity:   Velocity template processing
smartfrog-www:        Web support: Deployment and liveness pages
smartfrog-xml:        XML Support
smartfrog-xmpp:       XMPP/Jabber communications
smartfrog-xunit:      Distributed testing and reporting

All the JAR files are also published to a repository that is
compatible with Apache Maven and Ivy. Add
   http://smartfrog.sourceforge.net/repository/
to your repository list to pull SmartFrog artifacts into your Ivy- or
Maven- based build.

There are also SmartFrog components to retrieve artifacts from such a
repository which can be used for dynamic download of SmartFrog and
other artifacts, in /org/smartfrog/services/os/java/library.sf


Security warning
================

Unless SmartFrog is configured with security, a running daemon will
listen on its configured port for incoming deployment requests, and
deploy the applications with the rights of the user running the daemon.
When the smartfrog-daemon RPM is installed, that means that a process
running as root will be listening on an open port for incoming
deployment requests. Do not deploy SmartFrog this way on any untrusted
network, not without turning security on.

There is a special distribution .tar.gz file that can be used to
generate a private set of secure RPM files.

Building SmartFrog
==================

SmartFrog requires Java 1.6+ and Ant 1.8+ to build. The izpack and
source .zip and .tar.gz distributions include a source tree sufficient
to build the entire system. To build a later release, please follow
the instructions at
  http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=87384
to check out smartfrog/trunk/core from our repository.

This release was built with revision 8870 of the repository, which
is available under the SVN branch
https://smartfrog.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/smartfrog/tags/release3.18.016

We strongly encourage anyone interested in building or extending
SmartFrog to get involved in the SmartFrog developer mailing list,
which can be found from the sourceforge project page
http://sourceforge.net/projects/smartfrog/
