  <description>
    Example/Demo hadoop cluster deployment.

    This project contains no java source, just .sf files to deploy and anything else
    needed to bring up a cluster.

    To use the relevant targets, define properties for

    namenode
    datanode
    tasktracker
    jobtracker

    and run them. All will need the property namenode set
