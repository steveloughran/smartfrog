     * WRAPPER_CTRL_SHUTDOWN_EVENT.
     * <p/>
     * The WRAPPER_CTRL_C_EVENT will be called whether or not the JVM is
     * controlled by the Wrapper.  If controlled by the Wrapper, it is
     * undetermined as to whether the Wrapper or the JVM will receive this
     * signal first, but the Wrapper will always initiate a shutdown.  In most
     * cases, the implementation of this method should call
     * WrapperManager.stop() to initiate a shutdown from within the JVM. The
     * WrapperManager will always handle the shutdown correctly whether shutdown
     * is initiated from the Wrapper, within the JVM or both. By calling stop
     * here, it will ensure that the application will behave correctly when run

     * WRAPPER_CTRL_CLOSE_EVENT, WRAPPER_CTRL_LOGOFF_EVENT, and

     * will be triggered by the OS whether the JVM is being run as an NT service
     * or as a console application.  If the JVM is running as a console
     * application, the Application must respond to the CLOSE and LOGOFF events
     * by calling WrapperManager.stop() in a timely manner. In these cases,
     * Windows will wait for the JVM process to exit before moving on to signal
     * the next process.  If the JVM process does not exit within a reasonable
     * amount of time, Windows will pop up a message box for the user asking if
     * they wish to wait for the process or exit or forcibly close it.  The JVM
     * must call stop() in response to the SHUTDOWN method whether running as a
     * console or NT service.  Usually, the LOGOFF event should be ignored when
     * the Wrapper is running as an NT service.
