 * stability over time.

 * <p/> It's based upon Ant's own JUnit task, and credits Cactus as showing what could be done. Apache Cactus is coded
 * around deploying to an application server; this task can deploy to anything for which we have setup and teardown
 * sequences. <p/> <p/> This is the workflow for testing <ol> <li>The startup sequence is run to completion</li> <li>In
 * parallel, ( a) the application is started</li> <li>and (b) the sequence of waitfor+tests is run.</li> <li>After the
 * tests run, the teardown operation is executed</li> <li>Any build exception thrown by testingis thrown</li> </ol>
 *
 * <p>No matter what goes wrong, once startup has succeeded, teardown gets invoked. </p>
