 * Start an SF application, an application which will run asynchronously until

 * A smartfrog daemon must already be running on the target machine/port
 *
 * @ant.task category="SmartFrog" name="sf-deploy"
 * By default this target raises an error when the application cannot be stopped, and has a timeout
 * set to the standard default value. {@link SmartFrogTask#DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_VALUE}.
 * <p/>
 * <i>Important</i>. The codebase set for this task in the codebase elements define the codebase
 * for interpreting the deployment descriptor, but as the action of deployment is left to a daemon,
 * JAR files and referenced in the codebase are loaded by the daemon during deployment.
 * <p/>
 * To ensure that the daemon can actually load the files, you need to
 * <ol>
 * <li>Place them in a shared location (shared file system may work)
 * <li>Place URLs to the shared files in the smartfrog deployment descriptor's
 * <tt>sfCodebase</tt> attribute. The &lt;sf-tourl&gt; task can be used to create
 * a suitable URL from a file reference.
