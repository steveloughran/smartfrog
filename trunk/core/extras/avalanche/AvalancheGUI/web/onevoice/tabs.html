<h4>Primary Tabs</h4>

	<div class="tabOff"><a href="#">Networking</a></div>
	<div class="tabOn">Support</div>

<h4>Secondary Tabs</h4>
<div class="greyPanel" style="width:100%;padding-left:7px;">
	<br>
	<div class="secondaryTabSet">
		<div class="tabOff"><a href="#">Settings</a></div>

<h4>HTML/CSS</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Each tab consists of a single link wrapped within a div whose class is either "tabOff" or "tabOn". 
	<li>Sets of tabs are contained within a div whose class is either "tabSet" or "secondaryTabSet", depending on which variation you are implementing. 
	<li>there is a following div currently called "tabBottomLine", that is necessary to clear the CSS float:left layout used by the tabs. 
	<li>the only implementation difference between primary and secondary tabs is that secondary tabs are contained in a particular div. Currently that div has the class "secondaryTabSet". Visual differences are then taken care of by the css and js.
</ul>

<h4>Javascript</h4>
<ul>
	<li>TabManager.js contains a method to initialize the tabs when they are loaded 
	<li>Tab initialization consists of two parts
		<ol>
			<li>The background of the tabs is made clickable, essentially by rerouting the event to the anchor element within. 
			<li>On Internet Explorer 6, if the width of a tab is less than that specified in the design center, it is set the appropriate width at this time. If the width is already greater than the width specified in the design center no action is taken.  Note that this resizing script is not executed by Mozilla clients as Mozilla understands the min-width CSS properties that are set for tabs within the css. 
		</ol>
	</li>
</ul>
