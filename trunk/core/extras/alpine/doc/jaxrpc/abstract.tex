This paper examines the current SOAP APIs in Java, and in particular
the \emph{Java API for XML-based RPC}, commonly known as
JAX-RPC, which is effectively the standard API for SOAP on the
Java platform. We claim that JAX-RPC, and indeed any SOAP API that
relies on a perfect two-way mapping between XML data and native
language objects is fundamentally flawed. Furthermore, we claim that
the attempt JAX-RPC makes to extend the remote method invocation 
metaphor to SOAP services is counterproductive.

We base our reasoning from experience with JAX-RPC
and SOAP, and in the light of previous distributed computing
technologies. We argue that JAX-RPC is not capable of delivering on the
SOAP design goals, but conclude by suggesting an alternate system,
{\it Alpine}, which is free from many known flaws of existing systems,
and should prove better able to deliver on the promise of SOAP.
