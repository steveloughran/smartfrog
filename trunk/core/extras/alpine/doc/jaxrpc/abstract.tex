This paper examines the current SOAP APIs in Java, and in particular
the \emph{Java API for XML-based RPC}, commonly known as
JAX-RPC, which is effectively the standard API for SOAP on the
Java platform. We claim that JAX-RPC, and indeed any SOAP API that
relies upon a perfect two-way mapping between XML data and native
language objects is fundamentally flawed. Furthermore, we claim that
the attempt JAX-RPC makes to extend the remote method invocation 
metaphor to SOAP services is counterproductive.

We base our argument both upon experience with JAX-RPC and SOAP, and
upon experience of previous distributed computing technologies. We
argue that JAX-RPC is not capable of delivering on the SOAP design
goals, but conclude by suggesting an alternate system, {\it Alpine},
which is free from many known flaws of existing systems, and should
prove better able to deliver upon the promise of SOAP.
