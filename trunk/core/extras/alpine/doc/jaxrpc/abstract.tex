\begin{abstract}

This paper examines the current SOAP APIs Java, and
in particular JAX-RPC, which has become the de-facto and de-jure
standard for SOAP messaging on the Java platform. We claim that
JAX-RPC, and indeed any SOAP API that relies on a perfect mapping
between XML Schema types and native language objects is
fundamentally flawed. Furthermore, we claim the attempt that JAX-RPC
makes to extend the RMI metaphor to SOAP is
misguided. This paper sets out our reasoning, based on
experience with JAX-RPC and SOAP, and in the light of previous
distributed object technologies (eg CORBA).

We believe current approaches are not capable of delivering on the
SOAP design goals, but conclude by suggesting an alternative system
{\it Alpine} which is free from many known flaws of existing systems,
and should prove better able to deliver on the promise of SOAP.
