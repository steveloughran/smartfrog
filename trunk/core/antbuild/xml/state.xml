<project name="state">

  <description>

    This is a modelling of the state of a system.

    These targets do not contain any actions, instead they are things you can
    depend on an application being in before a next operation.

    This represents an alternate way of viewing a build. Instead of describing
    targets as actions "compile", "deploy", etc, you can have state targets that
    represent states an application passes through during a build. The action targets
    are those transformations applied to an application to get from one state to another.
