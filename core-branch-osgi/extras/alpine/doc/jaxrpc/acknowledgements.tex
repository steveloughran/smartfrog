The authors would like to thank Tim Ewald and Ted Neward for their
valuable feedback and corrections. One implementation of the CDDLM
deployment service was created for the OGSAConfig project, which is
funded by a grant from the Joint Information Systems Committee
(JISC). The other was produced in HP Laboratories, integrating
with the SmartFrog deployment infrastructure.
