# These properties override properties defined in the build file.
# As these properties are set before the environment is read, they
# cannot make use of these. but htey may override the environmental
# settings.

# example:

test.telnet.host=localhost
test.telnet.user=user
test.telnet.pass=passwd

test.telnet.windows.host=dosbox
test.telnet.windows.user=user
test.telnet.windows.pass=passwd
