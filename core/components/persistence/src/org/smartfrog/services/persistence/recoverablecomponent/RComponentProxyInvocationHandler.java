 * are implemented as dynamic proxies that use the RComponentProxyInvocationHandler
 * as their invocation handler.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The invocation handler uses three objects: the "direct" object; a "proxy
 * locator" object; and a "local override" object; The direct object is the
 * target recoverable component and the invocation handler actually holds an RMI
 * reference to it. In the event that the RMI reference becomes invalid, say
 * due to a failure of the target, a new one is obtained from the locator object.
 * This step is how the proxy rebinds to a new incarnation of the recoverable
 * component. The last object, the local override, intercepts some methods that
 * can be performed locally instead of invoking the target recoverable component.
 * These include methods that are required to work even with the recoverble component
 * is absent - the method "isDead" is an example.
