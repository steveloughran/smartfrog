      <title>Smart Framework for Object Groups</title>

      <p >SmartFrog is a technology
        for describing distributed software systems as collections of
        cooperating components, and then activating and managing them. It was
        developed at HP Labs in Bristol, in the UK. The core SmartFrog
        framework is released under
        <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html" target="_blank">LGPL</a>
        .
      </p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">SmartFrog project
        development is hosted on Sourceforge:

      <p >SmartFrog consists of a
        <b>language</b>
        for describing component collections and component
        configuration parameters, and a
        <b>runtime environment</b>
        which
        activates and manages the components to deliver and maintain running
        systems.

      <p>
        SmartFrog
        has wide applicability across domains ranging from utility computing
        to large-scale system configuration.
      </p>
      <p  >SmartFrog is a framework
        to build from, not a packaged solution. Typically, we write new
        components for each new service, and then use SmartFrog to describe
        and activate them. However, the framework is populated with a number
        of general purpose components that can be reused across services, and
        we are adding to their number.
      </p>
      <p>SmartFrog and its
        components are implemented in Java;, though SmartFrog
        components can easily be written to encapsulate software components
        based on other technologies.
