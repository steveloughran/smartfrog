	  <title>Smart Framework for Object Groups</title>

<p>
  SmartFrog is a technology
for describing distributed software systems as collections of
cooperating components, and then activating and managing them. It was
developed at HP Labs in Bristol, in the UK. The core SmartFrog
framework is released under the
 <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html" >LGPL</a>.
</p>
<p >SmartFrog project
development is hosted on Sourceforge:</p>

<p>SmartFrog consists of a
language for describing component collections and component
configuration parameters, and a runtime environmentwhich
activates and manages the components to deliver and maintain running
systems.

<p>
SmartFrog has wide applicability across domains ranging from utility computing
to large-scale system configuration. 
</p>
<p >SmartFrog is a framework
to build from, not a packaged solution. Typically, we write new
components for each new service, and then use SmartFrog to describe
and activate them. However, the framework is populated with a number
of general purpose components that can be reused across services, and
we are adding to their number.</p>
<p >SmartFrog and its
components are implemented in Java, though SmartFrog
components can easily be written to encapsulate software components
based on other technologies.</p>
