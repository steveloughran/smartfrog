 * Because the logger may be running on a remote system from the caller, it is
 * important to filter out unsent messages -especially debug messages- before
 * making a call over the network. There is a method in the interface, isDebugEnabled,
 * that returns true if debug messages should be sent out.
 * Obviously, making that call before every debug message is sent does not save any time
 * either, so if it is to be used, cache the return value.
