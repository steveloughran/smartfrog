<h1>SmartFrog 3.17.004</h1>

<p>
  This is a new release of SmartFrog, the Java-based, LPGL-licensed distributed
  deployment framework developed by HP Laboratories. SmartFrog enables
  applications to be deployed across multiple machines, configuring different
  aspects of the system so that they are all consistently configured, and managing
  the life-cycle of the application as a whole. The project's home page is
  <a href="http://smartfrog.org/">http://smartfrog.org/</a>

</p>

<p>
  This release is 3.17.004; built from revision 7234
  of the SVN repository. This release has an extended language
  with the ability to tag attributes, and includes the following items:
</p>
<ul>

  <li> Core smartfrog daemon, including services to manage files, start and stop
    Java and native programs.
  </li>
  <li> Example components and applications.
  </li>
  <li> Ant support: ant tasks to deploy and terminate applications from a build.
  </li>
  <li> Ant components: the ability to execute ant tasks in a deployment.
  </li>
  <li> Anubis: a partition aware tuple-space that can be used to implement fault
    tolerant systems.
  </li>
  <li> Database: components to issue database commands, and deploy HSLDB and MySQL
   databases.
  </li>
  <li> Hadoop: a version of Apache Hadoop with SmartFrog management, and
  support components to interact with Hadoop: filesystem operations and 
  Job submission. This is still experimental and must be considered unstable.
  </li>
  <li> JMX: the ability to configure and manage JMX components, and to manage
    SmartFrog components over JMX.
  </li>
  <li> Logging: integration with Apache commons-logging and Log4J, and the 
  SLF4J framework.
  </li>
  <li> Networking: email, FTP, SSH, DNS support.
  </li>
  <li> Quartz: scheduled operations using Quartz libraries.
  </li>
  <li> RpmTools: components for working with or deploying with RPMs</li>
  <li> Scripting: support for BSF-hosted scripting languages
  </li>
  <li> Testing: Distributed JUnit and component testing with SFUnit.
  </li>
   <li>
    Velocity: generation/transformation of text files during deployment
  </li>
  <li> WWW: deployment of WAR and EAR files to application servers. deploy-by-copy
    is provided for all application servers that support, and a tomcat-specific
    component can communicate with Apache Tomcat.</li>
  <li>Jetty: The Jetty component can
    configure and deploy individual servlets, eliminating much of the need for WAR
    files themselves.
  </li>
  <li> XML: XML support with XOM.
  </li>
  <li> XMPP: Presence and messaging over Jabber.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  All the JAR files are also published to a repository that is compatible with
  Apache Maven and Ivy. Add
  <a
          href="http://smartfrog.sourceforge.net/repository">http://smartfrog.sourceforge.net/repository</a>
  to your repository list to pull SmartFrog artifacts into your Ivy- or Maven- based build.
</p>

<p>
  There are also SmartFrog components to retrieve artifacts from such a repository
  (the Library components under /org/smartfrog/services/os/java/library.sf ),
  which can be used for dynamic download of SmartFrog and other artifacts.
</p>

<h3>Security warning</h3>

<p>
  Unless SmartFrog is configured with security, a running daemon
  will listen on its configured port for incoming deployment requests, and deploy
  the applications with the rights of the user running the daemon. When the
  smartfrog-daemon RPM is installed, that means that a process running as root
  will be listening on an open port for incoming deployment requests.
  Do not deploy SmartFrog this way on any untrusted
  network, not without turning security on.
</p>
<p>
  There is a special distribution .tar.gz file that can be used to generate
  a private set of secure RPM files.
</p>

<h3>Building SmartFrog</h3>

<p>
  SmartFrog requires Java 1.5+ and Ant 1.7+ to build. 
</p>

<p>

  system. Please follow the instructions at
  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=87384">http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=87384
  </a>
  and check out smartfrog/trunk/core from our repository.
