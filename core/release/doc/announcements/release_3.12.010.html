<h1>SmartFrog 3.12.010</h1>

<p>
  This is a new release of SmartFrog, the Java-based, LPGL-licensed distributed
  deployment framework developed by HP Laboratories. SmartFrog enables
  applications to be deployed across multiple machines, configuring different
  aspects of the system so that they are all consistently configured, and managing
  the life-cycle of the application as a whole. The project's home page is
  <a href="http://smartfrog.org/">http://smartfrog.org/</a>
</p>

  The release artifacts are available at

</p>

<p>
  This release is 3.12.010; built from revision 5471
  of the SVN repository. This release has an extended language
  with the ability to tag attributes, and includes the following items:
</p>
<ul>

  <li> Core smartfrog daemon, including services to manage files, start and stop
    Java and native programs.
  </li>
  <li> Example components and applications.
  </li>
  <li> Ant support: ant tasks to deploy and terminate applications from a build,

  </li>
  <li> Ant components: the ability to execute ant tasks in a deployment,
    and run complete Ant XML build files on local or remote systems.
  </li>
  <li> Anubis: a partition aware tuple-space that can be used to implement fault
    tolerant systems.
  </li>
  <li> Database: components to issue database commands, and deploy HSLDB and MySQL.
  </li>
  <li> JMX: the ability to configure and manage JMX components, and to manage
    SmartFrog components over JMX.
  </li>
  <li> Logging: integration with Apache commons-logging and Log4J
  </li>
  <li> Networking: email, FTP, SSH, DNS support.
  </li>
  <li> Quartz: scheduled operations using Quartz libraries.
  </li>
  <li> Scripting: support for BSF-hosted scripting languages
  </li>
  <li> Testing: Distributed JUnit and component testing with SFUnit.
  </li>
  <li> WWW: deployment of WAR and EAR files to application servers. deploy-by-copy
    is provided for all application servers that support, and a tomcat-specific
    component can communicate with Apache Tomcat. The Jetty component can
    configure and deploy individual servlets, eliminating much of the need for WAR
    files themselves.
  </li>
  <li> XML: XML support with XOM.
  </li>
  <li> XMPP: Presence and messaging over Jabber.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Packaging</h3>

<p>
  This release is available as:
</p>
<ol>
  <li> RPM files inside a .tar.gz file.
  </li>
  <li> a JAR installer.
  </li>
  <li>the original core smartfrog distribution as .zip and .tar.gz (deprecated)
  </li>
</ol>
<p>

  The RPM installation is for RPM-based Linux systems. It comprises three RPM
  files, smartfrog, smartfrog-daemon and smartfrog-demo:
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><code>smartfrog</code></td>
    <td>The core SmartFrog distribution.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>smartfrog-daemon</code></td>
    <td>The shell scripts to add the smartfrog distribution to the
      path, and to run the daemon on start-up.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>smartfrog-demo</code></td>
    <td>Example code and documentation</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>smartfrog-anubis</code></td>
    <td>Anubis partition-aware "tuple space"</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>smartfrog-logging</code></td>
    <td>Enhanced logging</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  All the JAR files are also published to a repository that is compatible with
  Apache Maven and Ivy. Add
  <a
          href="http://smartfrog.sourceforge.net/repository">http://smartfrog.sourceforge.net/repository</a>
  to your repository list to pull SmartFrog artifacts into your Ivy- or Maven- based build.
</p>

<p>
  There are also SmartFrog components to retrieve artifacts from such a repository
  (the Library components under /org/smartfrog/services/os/java/library.sf ),
  which can be used for dynamic download of SmartFrog and other artifacts.
</p>

<h3>Security warning</h3>

<p>

  Unless SmartFrog is configured with security, a running daemon
  will listen on its configured port for incoming deployment requests, and deploy
  the applications with the rights of the user running the daemon. When the
  smartfrog-daemon RPM is installed, that means that a process running as root
  will be listening on an open port for incoming deployment requests. Do not
  deploy SmartFrog this way on any untrusted network, not without turning security
  on and, ideally, recreating the RPMs with signed JAR files.
</p>

<h3>Building SmartFrog</h3>

<p>
  SmartFrog requires Java 1.5 and Ant 1.7 to build. 
</p>

<p>

  The distribution does not include a source tree adequate to build the entire
  system. Please follow the instructions at
  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=87384">http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=87384
  </a>
  and check out smartfrog/trunk/core from our repository.
</p>

<p>

  This release was built with revision 5471 of the repository, which
  is available under the SVN branch
  <a href="https://smartfrog.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/smartfrog/tags/release3.12.010">https://smartfrog.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/smartfrog/tags/release3.12.010</a>
</p>

<p>
  We strongly encourage anyone interested in building or extending smartfrog to
  get involved in the smartfrog developer mailing list, which can be found from
  the sourceforge project page
  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/smartfrog/">
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/smartfrog/</a>

<h3>Changes since last release</h3>

<p>
There have been no major changes to the core SmartFrog engine
or components since the last release. We have added some diagnostics;
any of the smartfrog commands can be called with the -diagnostics option,
which will print out diagnostic information about the environment
in which SmartFrog is running.
</p>
<p>
There is now an AntBuild component in the sf-ant package, defined in
/org/smartfrog/services/ant/components.sf . This component can run
an existing Ant build file inside a SmartFrog process, passing down
properties and collecting results. Output is passed to the SmartFrog log
infrastructure, and properties from the build can be turned into attributes
on a designated target component. Build failures can be configured to
terminate the component. If the AntBuild component is terminated mid-build,
a best-effort attempt will be made to interrupt the build; if that does not
halt the build within a specified timeout, termination can be forced.
</p>
<p>
This component enables you to integrate existing XML build files into
a SmartFrog managed deployment, potentially running a build file remotely.
Users are requested to provide feedback, to help improve the functionality of
the component. We are particularly interested in improving termination, failure
and reporting. We also have to complete the documentation for this component -
please ask on the mailing list for the location in the subversion repository
of the latest documentation.
