SmartFrog 3.12.003
======================

This is a new release of SmartFrog, the Java-based, LPGL-licensed
distributed deployment framework developed by HP Laboratories. SmartFrog
enables applications to be deployed across multiple machines,
configuring different aspects of the system so that they are all
consistently configured, and managing the life-cycle of the application
as a whole. The project's home page is http://smartfrog.org/

The release artifacts are available at

http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=87384&package_id=176308

This release is 3.12.003; built from revision 5152
of the SVN repository. This release has an extended language
with the ability to tag attributes, and includes the following items:

* Core smartfrog daemon, including services to manage files, start and stop
  Java and native programs.
* Example components and applications.  
* Ant support: ant tasks to deploy and terminate applications from a build.
* Ant components: the ability to execute ant tasks in a deployment.
* Anubis: a partition aware tuple-space that can be used to implement fault 
  tolerant systems.
* Database: components to issue database commands, and deploy HSLDB and MySQL.
* JMX: the ability to configure and manage JMX components, and to manage
  SmartFrog components over JMX.
* Logging: integration with Apache commons-logging and Log4J
* Networking: email, FTP, SSH, DNS support.
* Quartz: scheduled operations using Quartz libraries.
* Scripting: support for BSF-hosted scripting languages
* Testing: Distributed JUnit and component testing with SFUnit.
* WWW: deployment of WAR and EAR files to application servers. deploy-by-copy
  is provided for all application servers that support it, and sample templates
  are provided to start and stop Tomcat and JBoss. The Jetty component can
  configure and deploy individual servlets, eliminating much of the need for WAR
  files and application servers.
* XML: XML support with XOM.
* XMPP: Presence and messaging over Jabber.

Packaging
=========

This release is available as:

* RPM files inside a .tar.gz file.
* a JAR installer.
* the original core smartfrog distribution as .zip and .tar.gz (deprecated)


The RPM installation is for RPM-based Linux systems. It comprises three RPM
files, smartfrog, smartfrog-daemon and smartfrog-demo:

smartfrog:        the core SmartFrog distribution.
smartfrog-daemon: the shell scripts to add the smartfrog distribution to the
                  path, and to run the daemon on start-up.
smartfrog-demo:   example code and documentation.

*Important* 

One of the main area of changes between SmartFrog versions 3.12.000 and
3.12.003 is improvements in RPM installation and upgrades. Versions
3.12.003 onwards should upgrade in-situ installations correctly during
rpm -U operations. They can not upgrade 3.11.x or 3.12.000 RPMs. To 
install the latest RPM on a system that has a 3.11.x or 3.12.000
release installed, uninstall the existing RPMs using rpm -e (or rpm -e
--noscripts, if need be), before installing the newest release.

All the JAR files are also published to a repository that is compatible with
Apache Maven and Ivy. Add http://smartfrog.sourceforge.net/repository/
to your repository list to pull SmartFrog artifacts into your Ivy- or 
Maven- based build.

There are also SmartFrog components to retrieve artifacts from such a repository
(the Library components under /org/smartfrog/services/os/java/library.sf ),
which can be used for dynamic download of SmartFrog and other artifacts.


Security warning
================

Unless SmartFrog is configured with security, a running daemon will
listen on its configured port for incoming deployment requests, and
deploy the applications with the rights of the user running the daemon.
When the smartfrog-daemon RPM is installed, that means that a process
running as root will be listening on an open port for incoming
deployment requests. Do not deploy SmartFrog this way on any untrusted
network, not without turning security on and, ideally, recreating the
RPMs with signed JAR files.

Building SmartFrog
==================

SmartFrog requires Java 1.5 and Ant 1.7 to build. The izpack and source .zip and
.tar.gz distributions include a source tree adequate to build the
entire system. To build a later release, please follow the instructions at
  http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=87384
to check out smartfrog/trunk/core from our repository.

This release was built with revision 5152 of the repository, which
is available under the SVN branch
https://smartfrog.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/smartfrog/tags/release3.12.003

We strongly encourage anyone interested in building or extending
SmartFrog to get involved in the SmartFrog developer mailing list, which
can be found from the sourceforge project page
http://sourceforge.net/projects/smartfrog/

Changes since last release
==========================

The core changes to the SmartFrog system since 3.12.000 are:

1. Improvements in RPM packaging.
   -The RPMs are now upgradeable
   -All directories that are created are marked as owned by the specific
    RPMs, and are set up with the correct permissions and owner.
   -chkconfig is used to install and uninstall the init.d daemon on 
    RedHat systems
   -The init.d daemon's command set and return codes now follow the 
    Linux Standard Base guidelines.

2. Gradual Adoption of Java 5 features.
   We are gradually adopting out Java-5 Language features where the 
   benefits are immediately tangible. This is not visible to users of 
   SmartFrog, but means there are some CompoundImpl, which may be of 
   interest to anyone who has created new SmartFrog components by 
   extending this class.
   
3. Minor bug fixes.
