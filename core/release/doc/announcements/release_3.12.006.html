<h1>SmartFrog 3.12.006</h1>

<p>
  This is a new release of SmartFrog, the Java-based, LPGL-licensed distributed
  deployment framework developed by HP Laboratories. SmartFrog enables
  applications to be deployed across multiple machines, configuring different
  aspects of the system so that they are all consistently configured, and managing
  the life-cycle of the application as a whole. The project's home page is
  <a href="http://smartfrog.org/">http://smartfrog.org/</a>
</p>

<p>
  The release artifacts are available at

</p>

<p>
  This release is 3.12.006; built from revision 5245
  of the SVN repository. This release has an extended language
  with the ability to tag attributes, and includes the following items:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Core smartfrog daemon, including services to manage files, start and stop
    Java and native programs.
  </li>
  <li> Example components and applications.
  </li>
  <li> Ant support: ant tasks to deploy and terminate applications from a build.
  </li>
  <li> Ant components: the ability to execute ant tasks in a deployment.
  </li>
  <li> Anubis: a partition aware tuple-space that can be used to implement fault
    tolerant systems.
  </li>
  <li> Database: components to issue database commands, and deploy HSLDB and MySQL.
  </li>
  <li> JMX: the ability to configure and manage JMX components, and to manage
    SmartFrog components over JMX.
  </li>
  <li> Logging: integration with Apache commons-logging and Log4J
  </li>
  <li> Networking: email, FTP, SSH, DNS support.
  </li>
  <li> Quartz: scheduled operations using Quartz libraries.
  </li>
  <li> Scripting: support for BSF-hosted scripting languages
  </li>
  <li> Testing: Distributed JUnit and component testing with SFUnit.
  </li>
  <li> WWW: deployment of WAR and EAR files to application servers. deploy-by-copy
    is provided for all application servers that support, and a tomcat-specific
    component can communicate with Apache Tomcat. The Jetty component can
    configure and deploy individual servlets, eliminating much of the need for WAR
    files themselves.
  </li>
  <li> XML: XML support with XOM.
  </li>
  <li> XMPP: Presence and messaging over Jabber.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Packaging</h3>

<p>
  This release is available as:
</p>
<ol>
  <li> RPM files inside a .tar.gz file.
  </li>
  <li> a JAR installer.
  </li>
  <li>the original core smartfrog distribution as .zip and .tar.gz (deprecated)
  </li>
</ol>
<p>

  The RPM installation is for RPM-based Linux systems. It comprises three RPM
  files, smartfrog, smartfrog-daemon and smartfrog-demo:
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><code>smartfrog</code></td>
    <td>The core SmartFrog distribution.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>smartfrog-daemon</code></td>
    <td>The shell scripts to add the smartfrog distribution to the
      path, and to run the daemon on start-up.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>smartfrog-demo</code></td>
    <td>Example code and documentation</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>smartfrog-anubis</code></td>
    <td>Anubis partition-aware "tuple space"</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>smartfrog-logging</code></td>
    <td>Enhanced logging</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  All the JAR files are also published to a repository that is compatible with
  Apache Maven and Ivy. Add
  <a
          href="http://smartfrog.sourceforge.net/repository">http://smartfrog.sourceforge.net/repository</a>
  to your repository list to pull SmartFrog artifacts into your Ivy- or Maven- based build.
</p>

<p>
  There are also SmartFrog components to retrieve artifacts from such a repository
  (the Library components under /org/smartfrog/services/os/java/library.sf ),
  which can be used for dynamic download of SmartFrog and other artifacts.
</p>

<h3>Security warning</h3>

<p>

  Unless SmartFrog is configured with security, a running daemon
  will listen on its configured port for incoming deployment requests, and deploy
  the applications with the rights of the user running the daemon. When the
  smartfrog-daemon RPM is installed, that means that a process running as root
  will be listening on an open port for incoming deployment requests. Do not
  deploy SmartFrog this way on any untrusted network, not without turning security
  on and, ideally, recreating the RPMs with signed JAR files.
</p>

<h3>Building SmartFrog</h3>

<p>
  SmartFrog requires Java 1.5 and Ant 1.7 to build. 
</p>

<p>

  The distribution does not include a source tree adequate to build the entire
  system. Please follow the instructions at
  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=87384">http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=87384
  </a>
  and check out smartfrog/trunk/core from our repository.
</p>

<p>

  This release was built with revision 5245 of the repository, which
  is available under the SVN branch
  <a href="https://smartfrog.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/smartfrog/tags/release3.12.006">https://smartfrog.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/smartfrog/tags/release3.12.006</a>
</p>

<p>
  We strongly encourage anyone interested in building or extending smartfrog to
  get involved in the smartfrog developer mailing list, which can be found from

<h3>Changes since last release</h3>

<p>
SFOS-486: Add property to SF CLI to be able to load descriptions from the filesystem 
when security is on
</p>

<p>

If you set the environment variable SFSECURERESOURCES_OFF=ENABLED, then resources
can be loaded from unsigned JARs. In a daemon, this exposes in a security risk. 
In the client-side programs, this is a useful feature, as it means that even when 
SmartFrog is running in secure mode, it can parse and deploy SmartFrog descriptions
from the local filesystem. In this case the client node itself must be trusted, 
as malicious deployment descriptors could be instantiated. 
</p>

<p>

SFOS-357: Move Jetty support up to Jetty 6 (ongoing)
</p>

<p>

This release contains a preview of the Jetty-6 support in the Jetty component. This is not yet
stable; anyone using Jetty under SmartFrog should remain with a previous release of SmartFrog 3.12. 
Be advised that one change is not backwards compatible: the Jetty component is no longer a 
compound; you can no longer nest servlet and web application components under Jetty. Removing 
this feature makes the lifecyle of the server and its children more deterministic, and produces 
more stable deployments. 
</p>

<p>

However, it does mean that existing deployment descriptors will break. Plan for the change by 
moving all children of Jetty components into a Compound that deploys Jetty and its contents. 
</p>
