<h1>SmartFrog 3.12.008</h1>

<p>
  This is a new release of SmartFrog, the Java-based, LPGL-licensed distributed
  deployment framework developed by HP Laboratories. SmartFrog enables
  applications to be deployed across multiple machines, configuring different
  aspects of the system so that they are all consistently configured, and managing
  the life-cycle of the application as a whole. The project's home page is
  <a href="http://smartfrog.org/">http://smartfrog.org/</a>
</p>

<p>
  The release artifacts are available at
  <a

</p>

<p>
  This release is 3.12.008; built from revision 5390
  of the SVN repository. This release has an extended language
  with the ability to tag attributes, and includes the following items:
</p>
<ul>

  <li> Core smartfrog daemon, including services to manage files, start and stop
    Java and native programs.
  </li>
  <li> Example components and applications.
  </li>
  <li> Ant support: ant tasks to deploy and terminate applications from a build.
  </li>
  <li> Ant components: the ability to execute ant tasks in a deployment.
  </li>
  <li> Anubis: a partition aware tuple-space that can be used to implement fault
    tolerant systems.
  </li>
  <li> Database: components to issue database commands, and deploy HSLDB and MySQL.
  </li>
  <li> JMX: the ability to configure and manage JMX components, and to manage
    SmartFrog components over JMX.
  </li>
  <li> Logging: integration with Apache commons-logging and Log4J
  </li>
  <li> Networking: email, FTP, SSH, DNS support.
  </li>
  <li> Quartz: scheduled operations using Quartz libraries.
  </li>
  <li> Scripting: support for BSF-hosted scripting languages
  </li>
  <li> Testing: Distributed JUnit and component testing with SFUnit.
  </li>
  <li> WWW: deployment of WAR and EAR files to application servers. deploy-by-copy
    is provided for all application servers that support, and a tomcat-specific
    component can communicate with Apache Tomcat. The Jetty component can
    configure and deploy individual servlets, eliminating much of the need for WAR
    files themselves.
  </li>
  <li> XML: XML support with XOM.
  </li>
  <li> XMPP: Presence and messaging over Jabber.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Packaging</h3>

<p>
  This release is available as:
</p>
<ol>
  <li> RPM files inside a .tar.gz file.
  </li>
  <li> a JAR installer.
  </li>
  <li>the original core smartfrog distribution as .zip and .tar.gz (deprecated)
  </li>
</ol>
<p>

  The RPM installation is for RPM-based Linux systems. It comprises three RPM
  files, smartfrog, smartfrog-daemon and smartfrog-demo:
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><code>smartfrog</code></td>
    <td>The core SmartFrog distribution.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>smartfrog-daemon</code></td>
    <td>The shell scripts to add the smartfrog distribution to the
      path, and to run the daemon on start-up.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>smartfrog-demo</code></td>
    <td>Example code and documentation</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>smartfrog-anubis</code></td>
    <td>Anubis partition-aware "tuple space"</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>smartfrog-logging</code></td>
    <td>Enhanced logging</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  All the JAR files are also published to a repository that is compatible with
  Apache Maven and Ivy. Add
  <a
          href="http://smartfrog.sourceforge.net/repository">http://smartfrog.sourceforge.net/repository</a>
  to your repository list to pull SmartFrog artifacts into your Ivy- or Maven- based build.
</p>

<p>
  There are also SmartFrog components to retrieve artifacts from such a repository
  (the Library components under /org/smartfrog/services/os/java/library.sf ),
  which can be used for dynamic download of SmartFrog and other artifacts.
</p>

<h3>Security warning</h3>

<p>

  Unless SmartFrog is configured with security, a running daemon
  will listen on its configured port for incoming deployment requests, and deploy
  the applications with the rights of the user running the daemon. When the
  smartfrog-daemon RPM is installed, that means that a process running as root
  will be listening on an open port for incoming deployment requests. Do not
  deploy SmartFrog this way on any untrusted network, not without turning security
  on and, ideally, recreating the RPMs with signed JAR files.
</p>

<h3>Building SmartFrog</h3>

<p>
  SmartFrog requires Java 1.5 and Ant 1.7 to build. 
</p>

<p>

  The distribution does not include a source tree adequate to build the entire
  system. Please follow the instructions at
  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=87384">http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=87384
  </a>
  and check out smartfrog/trunk/core from our repository.
</p>

<p>

  This release was built with revision 5390 of the repository, which
  is available under the SVN branch
  <a href="https://smartfrog.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/smartfrog/tags/release3.12.008">https://smartfrog.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/smartfrog/tags/release3.12.008</a>
</p>

<p>
  We strongly encourage anyone interested in building or extending smartfrog to
  get involved in the smartfrog developer mailing list, which can be found from
  the sourceforge project page

<h3>Changes since last release</h3>

<p>
There have been various bug fixes and enhancements to the core, and to the Anubis, Jetty and SSH components
</p>

<h4>SFOS-506 new reference type: CONSTANT</h4>

<p>
There is a new reference type which can extract the value of a static field in
a Java class. This is useful for extracting text strings from existing code:
</p>
<pre>
 ExpectedText CONSTANT "org.smartfrog.example.Test.ErrorText"; 
</pre>
In this example, <code>ExpectedText</code> is set to the string constant <code>ErrorText</code> in the
class <code>org.smartfrog.example.Text</code>. The type of the resolved reference is that
of the static object, such as string or integer. <code>LAZY CONSTANT</code> references are evaluated on the SmartFrog host; non-LAZY references during preflight.

<h4>SFOS-512 rpmlint gives warnings and errors</h4>

<p>
There have been some changes to the RPM packaging, so rpmlint raises no errors
and less warnings. Specifically:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
 the .el4 suffix indicates the RPMs are compatible with RedHat Enterprise
  Linux 4
</li><li>
 the symbolic links from /opt/smartfrog/links to versionned artifacts are now
  managed by the rpm tools, instead of created and deleted by custom scripts.
 </li><li>
 the permissions on some files have been tightened.
</li>
</ol>

<h4>SFOS-357: Move Jetty support up to Jetty 6 (ongoing)</h4>
<p>
The migration of the Jetty components to Jetty 6 is now complete. Jetty
HTTP/HTTPS servers can be deployed, and web application and servlet contexts
deployed atop them. 
</p>
<ol><li>
Jetty 6 security is higher than before, with two consequences
 it is no longer possible to export a directory tree, and have Jetty
  create index pages.
  </li><li>
  Explicit index.html pages are required. Otherwise, a 403 forbidden or 404
  not-found response is generated
  </li><li>
 Web applications must explicitly list their welcome files in a section of
  web.xml. Consult the servlet documentation for the specifics of this.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
In our own testing, these security changes create the appearance
that Jetty is not deploying some web applications. It is deploying them, only
more securely than before.
</p>
<h4>SFOS-519 Move SSH Components up to jsch 0.1.31</h4>
<p>
The SSH components have moved up to Jsch-0.1.31, and rewritten internally
<ol><li>
 all implementation classes share the same base class and template descriptor
 </li><li>
 authentication policy (key or password) is now controlled via an attribute,
 <code>"authentication"</code>.
 </li><li>
 the components use the standard workflow attributes to control their
  termination policy.
  </li><li>
 all the configuration options are checked before a connection is attempted.
  This finds problems early, rather than late.
  </li><li>
 private key files for scp and sshexec, and the list of local files for scp,
  are now enhanced to take references to components implementing the FileIntf
  interface, as well as simple strings. This makes it easier to use components
  as sources of files.
  </li>
  </ol>
