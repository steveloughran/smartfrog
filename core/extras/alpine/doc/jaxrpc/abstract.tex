This paper examines the current SOAP APIs in Java, and in particular
JAX-RPC, which is effectively the standard for SOAP messaging on the
Java platform. We claim that JAX-RPC, and indeed any SOAP API that
relies on a perfect mapping between XML Schema types and native
language objects is fundamentally flawed. Furthermore, we claim that
the attempt JAX-RPC makes to extend the RMI metaphor to SOAP services
is misguided. 

This paper sets out our reasoning, based on experience with JAX-RPC
and SOAP, and in the light of previous distributed object
technologies. We argue that JAX-RPC is not capable of delivering on the
SOAP design goals, but conclude by suggesting an alternate system,
{\it Alpine}, which is free from many known flaws of existing systems,
and should prove better able to deliver on the promise of SOAP.
