\section{Alpine: a proposed alternative}
\label{alpine}

We are in the preliminary stages of designing an alternative SOAP
stack for Java, by the name of \emph{Alpine}.

\subsection{Manifesto}
\label{alpine:manifesto}

\tocheck{Our goal is to create a SOAP stack that is easy to use, robust, and
maintainable. In order to do this, we opt to step away from the
JAX-RPC, towards an approach which is XML centric. In avoiding O/X
mapping we greatly decrease the volume and complexity of our code.
Some may argue this will make Alpine more difficult to use, but
experience shows us that simpler systems are typically more
straightforward to work with, as they react in more predictable ways}.

If a WSDL description of an Alpine-hosted service is required, the
user will be required to write it: \tocheck{as we concluded in section
\ref{objections:o-x:wsdl-gen} generating WSDL from Java introduces
unwanted implementation dependencies and hampers interoperability.}

What will Alpine consist of then? With so much stripped out, a SOAP
stack gets reduced to its essentials: a system for managing the flow
of messages through a set of handlers, and libraries to handle
transport across supported the protocols. Core compliance with the
SOAP protocol will be provided, namely envelope validation and
\verb|mustUnderstand| processing of headers. Developers will be
expected to use XPath specifications to work with contents of the
message; we will depend upon XOM for our XML binding
\cite{harold:xom}.

\subsection{Design Goals}
\label{alpine:design}

The full design goals are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Stay in the XML Space as much as possible
\item Take advantage of as much leading edge infrastructure as we can
\item Adopt the the handler chain pattern of Axis/JAX-RPC
\item Target SOAP1.2 (POST) only, WS-I 1.1
\item Document/literal only
\item Java 1.5 or later 
\item Server side and client side, with both sides looking similar. 
\item No support for JAX-RPC or JAX-M/SAAJ.
\item Configurable only procedurally -or through JMX. 
\item One supported parser: Xerces

\item No provision of side features such as a built in HTTP server (e.g.
\verb|SimpleAxisServer|), or declarative configuration mechanism.
These are delegated to other products.
\end{enumerate}

By removing extraneous yet useful features, we introduce dependencies
on many other components to work correctly. Yet we also reduce
development and support effort.

This is not going to be a SOAP stack for use by anyone who wants to
make SOAP operations look like a remote procedure call; it is not
going to be for anyone who wants to ignore the format of the messages
sent or received over the wire.

Instead, it is going to provide the basic housekeeping and handler
chain management to make life simpler for XML experts who are prepared
to work with XOM.
