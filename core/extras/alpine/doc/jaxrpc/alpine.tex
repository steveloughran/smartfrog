\section{Alpine: a proposed alternative}

We are in the preliminary stages of designing an alternative SOAP
stack for Java, by the name of \emph{Alpine}.

\subsection{Manifesto}

Our goal is a SOAP stack that is easy to use, client or server, 
\emph{by Java developers who know XML}. 

There will be no attempt to perform O/X mapping, so bypassing all the
related problems. Similarly, a WSDL file must be hand written if it is
desired, so there is no need (or option) to generate one through
introspection.

Developers will be expected to use XPath specifications to work with
contents of the message; we well depend upon XOM for our XML binding
\cite{harold:xom}.

The full design goals are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Stay in the XML Space as much as possible
\item Take advantage of as much leading edge infrastructure as we can
\item Adopt the the handler chain pattern of Axis/JAX-RPC
\item Target SOAP1.2 (POST) only, WS-I 1.1
\item Document/literal only
\item Java 1.5 or later 
\item Server side and client side, with both sides looking similar. 
\item No support for JAX-RPC or JAX-M/SAAJ.
\item Configurable only procedurally -or through JMX. 
\item One supported parser: Xerces

\item No provision of side features such as a built in HTTP server (e.g.
\verb|SimpleAxisServer|), or declarative configuration mechanism.
These are delegated to other products.
\end{enumerate}

By removing extraneous yet useful features, we introduce dependencies
on many other components to work correctly. Yet we also reduce
development and support effort.

What is alpine going to consist of then? With so much stripped out, a
SOAP stack gets reduced to its essentials: a system for managing the
flow of messages through a set of handlers, and transports libraries
to handle transport across supported protocols. Core compliance with
the SOAP protocol would be provided: envelope validation,
\verb|mustUnderstand| processing of headers. 

This is not going to be a SOAP stack for use by anyone who wants to
make SOAP operations look like a remote procedure call; it is not
going to be for anyone who wants to ignore the format of the messages
sent or received over the wire.

Instead, it is going to provide the basic housekeeping and handler
chain management to make life simpler for XML experts who are prepared
to work with XOM.
