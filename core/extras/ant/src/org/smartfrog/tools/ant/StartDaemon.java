/**
 * Start a daemon. There is some fun here, as this can be spawning or non-spawning. if it spawns, it outlives ant (which
 * doesnt block), but output gets lost. This task only works on Ant1.6 or later, as that was when spawning was added to
 * the system. <p/> This task starts a daemon which is only terminated by external request, and which blocks the calling
 * thread until it terminates This means the build file calling this routine must either <ol> <li>execute it in a
 * separate thread (using parallel/sequential containers), and call &lt;sf-stopdaemon&gt; in a separate thread to end it
 * <li>set the standalone property to true to run it in a new process. <li>set the timeout to enforce a death time on
 * the process. </ol> Timeout killing of a process is somewhat brutal; we do not (yet) cleanly shut down the localhost,
 * though that is a distinctly possible option in future.
