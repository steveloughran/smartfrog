/**
 * Start a daemon. There is some fun here, as this can be spawning or non-spawning.
 * if it spawns, it outlives ant (which doesnt block), but output gets lost.
 * This task only works on Ant1.6 or later, as that was when spawning was added to the
 * system.
 * <p/>
 * This task starts a daemon which is only terminated by external request, and which
 * blocks the calling thread until it terminates
 * This means the build file calling this routine must either
 * <ol>
 * <li>execute it in a separate thread (using parallel/sequential containers),
 * and call &lt;sf-stopdaemon&gt; in a separate thread to end it
 * <li>set the standalone property to true to run it in a new process.
 * <li>set the timeout to enforce a death time on the process.
 * </ol>
 * Timeout killing of a process is somewhat brutal; we do not (yet) cleanly shut
 * down the localhost, though that is a distinctly possible option in future.
