 * Timeout is a modified compound which differs in that the single
 * sub-component is given a certain amount of time to terminate and if it has
 * not, the timeout combinator terminates it and itself abnormally. The

 * The timeout combinator creates its sub-componentent during the sfStart
 * phase The Timeout combinator waits for its sub-components to terminate
 * normally at which point it too terminates normally. If an error occurs at
 * any point, or a sub-component terminates abnormally, or the timeout fires
 * before its sub-component terminates, the Timeout combinator terminates
 * abnormally.
