<p>
This package contains classes to manage WWW deployment. Much of it is abstract or helper classes
for application server-specific subclassing and implementation.
</p>
<p>
    The core architecture is that the deployment components are server independent, the
    application server itself providing the core deployment functionality.
    To enable this, there is a notion of delegate classes; an application context
    can create a delegate class in a component to which it hands off most of the work.
